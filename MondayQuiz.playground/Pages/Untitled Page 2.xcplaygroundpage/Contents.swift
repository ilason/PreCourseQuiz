## Looping Through a Dictionary

Create a new dictionary called ages. Create five different key value pairs where the key is a person's name and the value is an Int of their age

Write a function that takes a dictionary parameter and loops through it and adds one to every person's age. The function should return the updated dictionary.

Don't forget to call the function at the bottom
